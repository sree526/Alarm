# Alarm
Alarm in AngularJS
 Tried to build a sample alarm app in angularjs. Anyway Alarm doesn't ring it will display a console message instead. You can have multiple alarms on same day and same alarm for multiple days. Still testing is pending. But I hope it might help someone
Used: AngularJS for building app, boostrap Datepicker for picking up the date, UI: Material Design.
